### Basic rules
1. Define the number of players and the budget for each player
2. One player picks the position and the player and the other players pick the player for that same postion
        - You pick the player by selecting the Card on the position you want to add the player
        - If you want to remove the player just click the card with the player and the modal will show up
4. Each player's team at the end has to have the following (it is indicated under the player name with different icons):
     - One player under 21 (21 icon)
     - One ICON player from FIFA (Football player icon)
     - No more than 2 players over 31 y/o
