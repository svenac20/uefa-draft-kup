# UEFA draft cup

Web implementation of the game me and my friends created when playing FIFA and building custom teams.
Technologies and tools used (T3 stack):
- **NextJs**
- **React**
- **Typescript**
- **Tailwind**
- **Zustand** - for managing state
- **React Query** - for fetching and caching

### Basic rules
1. Define the number of players and the budget for each player
2. One player picks the position and the player and the other players pick the player for that same postion
3. Each player's team at the end has to have the following (it is indicated under the player name with different icons):
     - One player under 21 (21 icon)
     - One ICON player from FIFA (Football player icon)
     - No more than 2 players over 31 y/o
